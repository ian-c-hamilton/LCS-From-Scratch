# LCS
## Learning Classifier Systems from Scratch

Learning Classifier Systems (LCS) are a type of machine learning algorithm originally conceived by Dr. John Holland in 1976 with his Cognitive System 1 (CS1). Whereas neural networks are designed to mimic the physical architecture of the brain, CS1 was designed to mimic how the brain thinks and learns. In its simplest description, LCS are a large collection of "if, then" statements where the condition-action pairs are evolved over time through a genetic algorithm, another invention of Dr. Holland. Through the evolution of many simple rules, complex interactions can form and the LCS starts to become a complex adaptive system, similar to large scale neural networks. However, LCS have many distinct advantages over neural networks and other machine learners. The largest of which is that their rule sets are completely transparent and human readable/interpretable. In fact, this is one of the main reasons why LCS were created.

In the early 1980's so-called "expert systems" were being developed by the symbolic AI community for things like medical diagnoses. The thought was that some or most of the work of a medical doctor could be off-loaded to a computer system that would take in symptoms as an input and produce a medical diagnosis as an output, creating an "if, then" structure. However, it quickly became apparent that it was impractical or impossible to hard code all the possible symptom-diagnosis combinations and interactions. Gary William Flake points out in his 1998 book, "The Computational Beauty of Nature", that LCS can use machine learning in the form of Holland's genetic algorithm to evolve complex "if, then" statements for applications like medical diagnosis.

In addition to having transparent rulesets, LCS often require less training data, are more maintanable, and more flexible in the types of problems they can address when compared to neural networks.

The applications for LCS are essentially endless, just like neural networks. However, due to their transparent nature, they are most aptly suited for industries where interpretation of the rule set is paramount. These industries include the medical, financial, nuclear, and insurance sectors.
